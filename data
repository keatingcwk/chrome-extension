"Can you explain Inception Financial's solar investment model work?": "Inception Financial offers a solar asset-based investment where investors purchase solar assets through a dedicated LLC, enabling direct ownership and control. The investment is structured to maximize tax benefits, including the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and accelerated depreciation.",

"Do I need a separate LLC for this investment, or can I use an existing entity?": "A separate LLC is recommended for liability protection and to ensure clear tax benefit treatment.",

"What ongoing costs should I expect as a solar investor?": "Costs include TSA fees, insurance, and potential maintenance expenses.",

"Can you tell me about the Technical Services Agreement (TSA), and what does it cover?": "The TSA covers system maintenance, monitoring, and performance optimization.",

"How is the TSA fee calculated, and how often is it paid?": "The TSA fee is $2.75 per kilowatt of DC capacity, charged quarterly.",
